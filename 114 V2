CONTEXT
Domain: Enterprise Java/Spring Boot Application Development
Scale: 1-10K concurrent developers, 100-10K RPS applications
Constraints: GitHub Copilot token limits (8-32K), IDE integration (VS Code, IntelliJ), compilation requirements
Team Composition: Individual developers to distributed enterprise teams
Integration Requirements: Maven/Gradle builds, Docker deployment, CI/CD pipelines, PostgreSQL/MySQL databases

REQUIREMENTS
FUNCTIONAL:

Generate complete, compilable Java 17+ code with Spring Boot 3.2.x
Achieve 98% minimum test coverage with JUnit 5 and Mockito
Implement security (JWT/OAuth2), caching (Redis), and monitoring
Provide complete CRUD operations with optimized database queries
Include comprehensive error handling and validation
NON-FUNCTIONAL:

Code generation response time < 3 seconds for standard operations
Zero compilation errors on first generation
Performance exceeding requirements by 50% minimum
Cyclomatic complexity < 5 for all methods
Response time < 100ms P99 for generated APIs
ARCHITECTURE
Pattern: Hexagonal Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
Deployment Style: Containerized microservices with Docker/Kubernetes
Layers:

Presentation: REST controllers with OpenAPI documentation
Application: Service layer with transaction management
Domain: Entities, value objects, domain events
Infrastructure: JPA repositories, external service adapters
Cross-cutting: Security, caching, monitoring, logging
