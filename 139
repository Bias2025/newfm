CONTEXT
Domain: Educational Java programming exercise reconstruction
Scale: Single-threaded console application with exception handling
Constraints:
Must reconstruct fragmented code from "refrigerator magnets"
Must produce exact output: "thaws" when arg="yes", "throws" when arg="no"
Missing curly braces need to be properly placed
Code fragments are intentionally scrambled
Team Composition: Java learners studying exception handling
Integration Requirements: Standalone Java application, command-line execution

REQUIREMENTS
Functional Requirements:

Reconstruct working Java program from provided code fragments
Handle command-line arguments ("yes" or "no")
Implement custom exception (MyEx extends Exception)
Use try-catch-finally blocks correctly
Produce exact console output as specified
Non-Functional Requirements:

Must compile with Java 17+
Zero compilation warnings
Proper exception handling flow
Educational clarity for learning purposes

ARCHITECTURE
Pattern: Simple procedural with exception handling demonstration
Style: Educational example showcasing try-catch-finally semantics
Layers:
Main entry point with argument processing
Exception throwing logic based on input
Output generation through strategic print statements

FRAMEWORK
Java Version: 17+ (using modern best practices)
Build: Direct javac compilation
Testing: Manual verification against expected outputs
Code Style: Educational clarity over production optimization

TECHNOLOGY
Core Java exception handling
System.out for console output
Command-line argument processing
Custom exception classes

TESTING
Test case 1: java ExTestDrive yes → outputs "thaws"
Test case 2: java ExTestDrive no → outputs "throws"
Edge cases: null input, empty input, invalid input

PERSONA
Senior Java instructor with 10+ years teaching experience, specializing in making complex concepts accessible through hands-on exercises.

ORIGINALITY
Clever use of print statement positioning to create different words based on exception flow, demonstrating try-catch-finally execution order.
